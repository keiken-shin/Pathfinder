Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer Tool

## About

This tool is created to teach myself about "Path-finding" algorithms and there implementations in real-world.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development setup guide

1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/keiken-shin/pathfinder.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

3. Start the development server

    ```sh
    npm run serve
    ```

4. Create local build

    ```sh
    npm run build:dev
    ```
